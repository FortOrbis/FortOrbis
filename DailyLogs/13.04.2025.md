I discovered a way to bypass the issue causing the game to forcefully exit with the message:  
"Exiting due to OSS correction attempt to unpinned Protocol."
To resolve it, I performed a character string search and found the relevant string at address `D8C1E96`. I then patched the compare function that triggers the crash, effectively stopping the game from closing itself.
However, while this bypass prevents the crash, the game now gets stuck on the "Searching for updates" screen so the main problem has shifted, but it's still not fully resolved.
